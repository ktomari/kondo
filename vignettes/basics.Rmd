# Finding Duplicates

We'll test this code with some dummy data. There are essentially two datasets built into this package and both are derived from `data(iris)`. From these two data subsets, there are essentially two files, each with some sort of duplication. There is a file with the same file name (and data), and another file that is simply a data duplicate, but with its own unique name.

```{r}
# Get path to extdata directory
extdata_path <- system.file("extdata", package = "kondo")

list.files(system.file("extdata", "test_iris"))
```
